# azureipam_block (Resource)

The block resource allows you to create a IPAM block in a specific Space.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create a new block in ua space
resource "azureipam_block" "new" {
  space = "au"
  name  = "AustraliaNorth"
  cidr  = "10.85.0.0/16"
}
output "space" {
  value = azureipam_block.new
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `cidr` (String) The IP range to configure to the block, in cidr notation.
- `name` (String) Name of the block.
- `space` (String) Name of the space where the block must be created. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

## Import

Blocks can be imported using the name of the space and the name of the block, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azureipam_space.new au/AustraliaNorth
```

-> This ID format is unique to Terraform and is composed of the space name and the block name in the format `{SpaceName}/{BlockName}`.
